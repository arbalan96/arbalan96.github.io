# About me
----------

Hi! I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), working with Rupak Majumdar.

My research interests include parameterized verification, automata theory, counter models and well-quasi orders.
You can find more about my research on [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/215/5409.html).
