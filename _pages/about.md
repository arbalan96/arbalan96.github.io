# About me
----------

Hi! I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), working with Rupak Majumdar.
I received my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Munich under Prof. Javier Esparza (2019 - 2024).
I also worked briefly as a Vertretungsprofessur (Interim professor) at the Technical University of Munich from October 2024 till March 2025.

My research interests include the algorithmic analysis of infinite-state systems and its applications to formal verification and parameterized systems.
My work is focused on understanding the precise complexity of analysis of infinite-state systems.
Beyond that, I am also interested in developing tractable approximations for systems for which exact analysis is infeasible.
