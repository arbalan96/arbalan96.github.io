# About me
----------

Hi! I am currently an interim professor at the Technical University of Munich from October 2024 till March 2025.
Before this, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS), working with Rupak Majumdar.

I received my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Munich under Prof. Javier Esparza (2019 - 2024).
My research interests include parameterized verification, automata theory, counter models and well-quasi orders.
You can find more about my research on [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/215/5409.html) or you can check out my [CV](https://arbalan96.github.io/cv.pdf)
for more information aboue me.
